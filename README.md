## 1. Data Preprocessing
We undertook a meticulous gathering of datasets from two notable insurance organizations, PMD and Mobility. Following this, we meticulously refined and organized the data to guarantee its accuracy and suitability for thorough analysis. This comprehensive data preparation procedure is designed to eradicate irregularities and confirm the dataset's appropriateness for modeling. The integration of varied datasets allows us to confirm the strength and adaptability of our models in different motor insurance scenarios.

## 2. Feature Engineering
Through the application of sophisticated techniques informed by domain expertise, we methodically identified and extracted relevant features from the dataset. This intricate procedure involved utilizing knowledge specific to the domain and employing methodologies to enhance the predictive capability of the chosen features. By enriching the dataset with meaningful features, we aimed to boost the performance and precision of our predictive models.
